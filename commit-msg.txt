feat: UI/UX enhancements and readability improvements

Summary of changes:

1. Responsiveness & Mobile Optimization:
   - Adjusted hero and section heading font sizes for mobile devices to prevent text overflow.
   - Refined padding and element scaling in Service cards and the Wedding section for better mobile balance.
   - Improved tag wrapping in service cards for smaller screens.

2. Services Component Refinement:
   - Aligned background with the Portfolio section (dark theme).
   - Added bold black 2px borders and sharp drop-shadows to icon containers for a high-contrast look.
   - Implemented "verticalTags" layout specifically for Social Media Management to handle long text.
   - Updated UI elements (buttons, categories) for better visibility on dark backgrounds.

3. Hero Section Visuals:
   - Added a dynamic orange gradient aura and border glow around the hero logo.
   - Implemented an interactive zoom-in effect on hover that subtly dims the background glow to focus on the brand.

4. Typography & Readability:
   - Loosened letter-spacing (from tracking-tighter to tracking-tight) across Footer, Services, and Home page.
   - This improves the legibility of long brand names and technical terms while maintaining the premium bold aesthetic.
