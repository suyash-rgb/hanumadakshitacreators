fix: responsiveness issues on mobile view

Key Fixes:

1. Fixed "unforgettable" Text Truncation:
  - Reduced the font size of the heading in the Wedding & Event Special section from text-5xl to text-4xl on mobile devices.
  - Reduced the internal padding of that section from p-12 to p-6 on mobile to give the long words more horizontal space.

2. Resolved Overlapping in Service Cards:
  - Padding & Font Sizes: Reduced the card padding and title font sizes on mobile to prevent elements from squeezing each other.
  - Responsive Tags: Scaled down the service tags (text-[9px] and smaller padding) so they wrap more naturally without overflowing the card boundaries.
  - Scaled UI Elements: Reduced the size of icons and the "Top Rated" badge on mobile for a more balanced layout.

3. Hero Section Optimization:
  - Adjusted the main hero heading font size to text-5xl on mobile (down from text-6xl) to ensure "Creating Stories" and other text fits perfectly on narrower screens.
