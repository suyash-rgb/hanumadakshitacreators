refactor: overhaul website layout and architecture

This commit represents a complete design and content overhaul of the 
HanumaDakshita Creators website, inspired by the minimalist and 
high-impact aesthetic of Aekam.

Key Changes:
- Replaced Geist font with Poppins for a premium creative agency feel.
- Updated metadata and unified branding to "HanumaDakshita Creators".
- Implemented a sticky glassmorphism Navbar with scroll transitions.
- Refactored 'Services' into a standalone component with cinematic 
  image-based cards, zoom hover effects, and improved tag contrast.
- Refactored 'WhyChooseUs' into a separate component with a landscape 
  aspect ratio (1.8:1) to prevent image cropping.
- Redesigned the Hero section for bold typographic impact.
- Updated 'About Us' page content and layout to align with new theme.
- Improved 'Footer' and global CSS variables for better design consistency.
- Swapped 'Photography' service asset with the new photography.webp.
- Added glassmorphism and text-glow utilities to the global style sheet.
